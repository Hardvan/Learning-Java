# Intro to OOPs

## Class

Blueprint for creating objects

## Object

Instance of a class

Note:

- Class is just a template
- Memory is allocated only after object instantiation

## Components of a class

- Attributes (Properties)
- Methods (Behavior)

## OOPs Terminology

### 1. Abstraction

- Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user
- Eg: A car is an abstraction of the internal combustion engine

### 2. Encapsulation

- Binding the data & the methods that operate on the data together
- In Java, encapsulation simply means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the user
- Eg: A laptop has a keyboard, a screen, a battery, etc. All these are encapsulated together

### 3. Inheritance

- The act of deriving a new class from an existing class
- New class: Derived/Child/Sub class
- Existing class: Base/Parent/Super class
- Eg: Tiger is a derived class of Animal

### 4. Polymorphism

- The ability of an object to take on many forms
- **Static (Compile-time) Polymorphism**
    - Method Overloading: Same method name with different parameters
- **Dynamic (Run-time) Polymorphism**
    - Method Overriding: Same method name with same parameters in parent and child class
